# TL1 Server & Server Implementation 
Java TL1 Server and Client Implementation 

I'll help you create a TL1 (Transaction Language 1) server and client in Java. TL1 is commonly used in telecommunications for network element management, which aligns with your telco industry experience.

Now I'll create a step-by-step guide for running and testing the TL1 server and client:

[TL1 Server & Client Setup Guide]("src/server_client_setup.md")

I've created a complete TL1 server and client implementation in Java for you. Here's what I've provided:

### Key Components:

1. TL1Message.java - Handles TL1 message parsing and formatting
2. TL1Server.java - Multi-threaded server that handles TL1 commands
3. TL1Client.java - Interactive client with sample commands

### Features Implemented:

Standard TL1 Commands: 
- RTRV, ED, ENT, DLT, ACT, CANC
- Multi-threaded Server: Handles multiple concurrent clients
- Interactive Client: Command-line interface with help system
- Message Parsing: Proper TL1 format parsing and validation
- Error Handling: Graceful error responses for invalid commands
- Logging: Built-in logging for debugging and monitoring

### How to Use:

1. Compile all three Java files
2. Start the server in one terminal
3. Start the client in another terminal
4. Type TL1 commands or use "help" for examples

The implementation follows telecommunications industry standards for TL1 communication, which is perfect for your telco industry background. The server can easily be extended to integrate with your PostgreSQL or Oracle databases to store network element configurations and states.

Would you like me to show you how to add database integration or any other specific enhancements?
